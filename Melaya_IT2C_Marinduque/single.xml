		<comment1>"Marinduque holds a special place in my heart. The tour I took there was an unforgettable journey through rich culture and history. The Moriones Festival, which takes place during Holy Week, is a sight to behold. The vibrant parades and reenactments of biblical events are truly captivating. Besides the festival, I also enjoyed exploring the ancestral houses in Gasan and discovering the island's heritage. The Bellarocca Island Resort is a luxurious retreat with breathtaking views and top-notch amenities. Marinduque offers a perfect blend of cultural immersion and relaxation."</comment1>
